#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHART PARAMETERS
# This file declares the configuration input values for the k8s-service Helm chart.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REQUIRED VALUES
# These values are expected to be defined and passed in by the operator when deploying this helm chart.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# containerImage is a map that describes the container image that should be used to serve the application managed by
# this chart.
# The expected keys are:
#   - repository (string) (required) : The container image repository that should be used.
#                                      E.g `nginx` ; `gcr.io/kubernetes-helm/tiller`
#   - tag        (string) (required) : The tag of the image (e.g `latest`) that should be used. We recommend using a
#                                      fixed tag or the SHA of the image. Avoid using the tags `latest`, `head`,
#                                      `canary`, or other tags that are designed to be “floating”.
#   - pullPolicy (string)            : The image pull policy to employ. Determines when the image will be pulled in. See
#                                      the official Kubernetes docs for more info. If undefined, this will default to
#                                      `IfNotPresent`.
#
# The following example deploys the `nginx:stable` image with a `IfNotPresent` image pull policy, which indicates that
# the image should only be pulled if it has not been pulled previously.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# containerImage:
#   repository: nginx
#   tag: stable
#   pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

# applicationName is a string that names the application. This is used to label the pod and to name the main application
# container in the pod spec. The label is keyed under "gruntwork.io/app-name"


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL VALUES
# These values have defaults, but may be overridden by the operator
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# containerCommand is a list of strings that indicate a custom command to run for the container in place of the default
# configured on the image. Omit to run the default command configured on the image.
#
# Example (run echo "Hello World"):
#
# containerCommand:
#   - "echo"
#   - "Hello World"
containerCommand: null

# containerPorts is a map that specifies the ports to open on the container. This is a nested map: the first map lists
# the named ports, while the second layer lists the port spec. The named references can be used to refer to the specific
# port of the container in other resources, like Service.
# The expected keys of the port spec are:
#   - port     (int)    (required) : The port in the container that should be exposed.
#   - protocol (string) (required) : The network protocol (e.g TCP or UDP) that is exposed.
#   - disabled (bool)              : Whether or not this port is disabled. This defaults to false if unset. Provided as a
#                                    convenience to override the default ports on the commandline. For example, to
#                                    disable the default port, you can pass `--set containerPorts.http.disabled=true`.
#
# The default config exposes TCP port 80 and binds the name `http` to it.
containerPorts:
  http:
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP

# livenessProbe is a map that specifies the liveness probe of the main application container. Liveness probes indicate
# when a container has reached a fatal state where it needs to be restarted to recover. When the liveness probe fails,
# the container is automatically recreated. You can read more about container liveness probes in the official docs:
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the container spec.
#
# The following example specifies an http GET based liveness probe, that will base the probe on a http GET request to
# the port bound to name `http` (see description on `containerPorts`) on the path `/`.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# livenessProbe:
#   httpGet:
#     path: /
#     port: http
livenessProbe: {}

# readinessProbe is a map that specifies the readiness probe of the main application container. Readiness probes
# indicate when a container is unable to serve traffic. When the readiness probe fails, the container is cycled out of
# the list of available containers to the `Service`. You can read more about readiness probes in the official docs:
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the container spec.
#
# The following example specifies an http GET based readiness probe, that will base the probe on a http GET request to
# the port bound to name `http` (see description on `containerPorts`) on the path `/`.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# readinessProbe:
#   httpGet:
#     path: /
#     port: http
readinessProbe: {}

# securityContext is a map that specified the privillege and access control settings for a Pod of Container. Security Context
# can be specified when the application requires additional access control permissions. More details on securityContext and supported
# settings can be found at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/
# similar to the podSecurityContext {} however, this sets security attributes at the container level rather than at the pod level scope.

#
# EXAMPLE:
# 1) To run a container in privilleged mode
# securityContext:
#   privilleged: true
#
# 2) To run a container as a specific user
# securityContext:
#   runAsUser: 2000
securityContext: {}

# podSecurityContext holds pod-level security access control settings.
# similar to the securityContext {} however, this sets security attributes at the pod level rather than at the container level scope.
# this allows certain attributes to be set that are not possible in the container level. For example 'fsGroup'.
# more details can be found at https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.20/#podsecuritycontext-v1-core

# EXAMPLE:
# podSecurityContext:
#   fsGroup: 2000
podSecurityContext: {}


# shutdownDelay is the number of seconds to delay the shutdown sequence of the Pod by. This is implemented as a sleep
# call in the preStop hook. By default, this chart includes a preStop hook with a shutdown delay for eventual
# consistency reasons. You can read more about why you might want to do this in
# https://blog.gruntwork.io/delaying-shutdown-to-wait-for-pod-deletion-propagation-445f779a8304
# You can disable this behavior by setting this value to 0.
# NOTE: this conflicts with lifecycleHooks.preStop
shutdownDelay: 5

# lifecycleHooks configures container lifecycle hooks on the Pod so you can run arbitrary commands after the
# container starts (postStart) or before the container stops.
# Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/ for more information on container
# lifecycles.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# lifecycleHooks:
#   enabled: true
#   postStart:
#     exec:
#       command:
#         - echo
#         - "Run after starting container"
#   preStop:
#     exec:
#       command:
#         - echo
#         - "Run before stopping container"
#
# NOTE: the preStop hook conflicts with shutdownDelay
lifecycleHooks:
  enabled: false

# sideCarContainers specifies any additional containers that should be deployed as side cars to the main application
# container. This will be included in the Deployment container spec so that it will be included in the application Pod.
# This is a nested map, where the first map key is used to name the container, with the nested map being injected as the
# container spec.
#
# The following example specifies a data dog agent container as a side car with some environment variables, binding the
# name `datadog`:
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# sideCarContainers:
#   datadog:
#     image: datadog/agent:latest
#     env:
#       - name: DD_API_KEY
#         value: ASDF-1234
#       - name: SD_BACKEND
#         value: docker
sideCarContainers: {}

# initContainers specifies any additional containers that should be deployed as init containers to the main application
# container. This will be included in the Deployment container spec so that it will be included in the application Pod.
# This is a nested map, where the first map key is used to name the container, with the nested map being injected as the
# container spec.
#
# The following example specifies a flyway image as an init container with an environment variable, binding the
# name `flyway`:
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# initContainers:
#   flyway:
#     image: flyway/flyway
#     env:
#       - name: FLYWAY_LOCATIONS
#         value: 'filesystem:/flyway/migrations'
initContainers: {}

# canary specifies test pod(s) that are deployed alongside your application's stable track pods.
# It is useful for testing a new release candidate in a production environment with minimal disruption and
# for allowing you to find any issues early.
# The expected keys of the canary spec are:
#   - enabled        (bool) (required) : Whether or not the canary deployment should be created. If false, no canary deployment will be created.
#   - containerImage (map)  (required) : A map that specifies the application container and tag to be managed by the canary deployment.
#                                        This has the same structure as containerImage.
#   - replicaCount   (int)             : The number of pods that should be managed by the canary deployment. Defaults to 1 if unset.
#
# The following example specifies a simple canary deployment:
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# canary:
#   enabled: true
#   replicaCount: 1
#   containerImage:
#     repository: nginx
#     tag: 1.16.0
#     pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
canary: {}

# replicaCount can be used to configure the number of replica pods that should be deployed and maintained at any given
# point in time. For example, setting to 3 will signal Kubernetes (via the Deployment contoller) to maintain 3 pods.
replicaCount: 1

# deploymentStrategy specifies the strategy used to replace old Pods by new ones. Type can be "RollingUpdate" or
# "Recreate". "RollingUpdate" is the default value.
# RollingUpdate: The Deployment updates Pods in a rolling update fashion.
# Recreate: All existing Pods are killed before new ones are created.
#
# RollingUpdate can be further refined by providing custom rollingUpdate options.
# The rollingUpdate variable is a map that is directly injected into the deployment spec and it has the following keys:
#   - maxUnavailable   (Optional) :  Field that specifies the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable
#                                    during the update process. The value can be an absolute number
#                                    (for example, 5) or a percentage of desired Pods (for example, 10%).
#                                    The value cannot be 0 if rollingUpdate.maxSurge is 0.
#                                    This option defaults to 25%.
#   - maxSurge         (Optional) :  Field that specifies the maximum number of Pods that can be created over
#                                    the desired number of Pods. The value can be an absolute number (for example, 5)
#                                    or a percentage of desired Pods (for example, 10%). The value cannot be 0 if
#                                    MaxUnavailable is 0.
#                                    This option defaults to 25%.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# deploymentStrategy:
#   enabled: false
#   type: RollingUpdate
#   rollingUpdate:
#     maxSurge: 30%
#     maxUnavailable: 30%
deploymentStrategy:
  enabled: false
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate: {}

# deploymentAnnotations will add the provided map to the annotations for the Deployment resource created by this chart.
# The keys and values are free form, but subject to the limitations of Kubernetes resource annotations.
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the deployment spec.
deploymentAnnotations: {}

# additionalDeploymentLabels will add the provided map to the labels for the Deployment resource created by this chart.
# this is in addition to the helm template related labels created by the chart
# The keys and values are free form, but subject to the limitations of Kubernetes labelling.
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the deployment spec.
additionalDeploymentLabels: {}

# podAnnotations will add the provided map to the annotations for the Pod resource created by the Deployment.
# The keys and values are free form, but subject to the limitations of Kubernetes resource annotations.
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the pod spec.
podAnnotations: {}

# additionalDeploymentLabels will add the provided map to the labels for the Pods created by the deployment resource.
# this is in addition to the helm template related labels created by the chart
# The keys and values are free form, but subject to the limitations of Kubernetes labelling.
# The match labels for the deployment aren't affected by these additional labels
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the deployment spec.
additionalPodLabels: {}

# minPodsAvailable specifies the minimum number of pods that should be available at any given point in time. This is
# used to configure a PodDisruptionBudget for the included pod. See
# https://blog.gruntwork.io/avoiding-outages-in-your-kubernetes-cluster-using-poddisruptionbudgets-ef6a4baa5085
# for an introduction to PodDisruptionBudgets.
# NOTE: setting this to 0 will skip creating the PodDisruptionBudget resource.
minPodsAvailable: 0

# service is a map that specifies the configuration for the Service resource that is created by the chart.
# The expected keys are:
#   - enabled     (bool)   (required) : Whether or not the Service resource should be created. If false, no Service
#                                       resource will be created.
#   - type        (string)            : The Service type, as defined in Kubernetes
#                                       (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types)
#                                       Defaults to ClusterIP.
#   - annotations (map)               : Annotations that should be added to the Service resource. This is injected
#                                       directly in to the resource yaml.
#   - ports       (map)    (required) : A map that specifies the port bindings of the service against the Pods in the
#                                       Deployment. This has the same structure as containerPorts, with the additional
#                                       key of `targetPort` to indicate which port of the container the service port
#                                       should route to. The `targetPort` can be a name defined in `containerPorts`.
#   - sessionAffinity (string)        : Used to maintain session affinity, as defined in Kubernetes - supports 'ClientIP' and 'None'
#                                       (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies)
#                                       Kubernetes defaults to None.
#   - sessionAffinityConfig (object)  : Configuration for session affinity, as defined in Kubernetes
#                                       (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies)
#
# The following example uses the default config and enables client IP based session affinity with a maximum session
# sticky time of 3 hours.
# EXAMPLE:
# 
# service:
#   enabled: true
#   ports:
#     app:
#       port: 80
#       targetPort: http
#       protocol: TCP
#   sessionAffinity: ClientIP
#   sessionAffinityConfig:
#     clientIP:
#       timeoutSeconds: 10800
# 
# The default config configures a Service of type ClusterIP with no annotation, and binds port 80 of the pod to the
# port 80 of the service, and names the binding as `app`:
service:
  enabled: true
  ports:
    app:
      port: 80
      targetPort: http
      protocol: TCP

# servicemonitor is a map that can be used to configure a Service monitor for the operator. By default, service monitor is off.
# The expected keys are:
#   - enabled     (bool)         (required) : Whether or not the Service Monitor resource should be created. If false, no
#                                             Service Monitor resource will be created.
#   - namespace   (string)       (required) : Namespace of Endpoints object.
#   - endpoints   (list[map])    (required) : An object used to discovers targets from listed endpoints of a service.
#                                             For each endpoint address one target is discovered per port.
#                                             If the endpoint is backed by a pod, all additional container ports of the pod,
#                                             not bound to an endpoint port, are discovered as targets as well.
#
# The following example specifies a ServiceMonitor rule that describes the set of targets to be monitored by Prometheus.
# EXAMPLE:
#
# serviceMonitor:
#   enabled: true
#   namespace: monitoring
#   endpoints:
#     default:
#       interval: 10s
#       scrapeTimeout: 10s
#       honorLabels: true
#       path: /metrics
#       port: http
#       scheme: http
serviceMonitor:
  enabled: false
  namespace: monitoring
  labels: {}
  endpoints: {}

# ingress is a map that can be used to configure an Ingress resource for this service. By default, turn off ingress.
# NOTE: if you enable Ingress, then Service must also be enabled.
# The expected keys are:
#   - enabled     (bool)         (required)  : Whether or not the Ingress resource should be created. If false, no
#                                              Ingress resource will be created.
#   - annotations (map)                      : Annotations that should be added to the Service resource. This is
#                                              injected directly in to the resource yaml.
#   - tls         (list[map])                : Sets up TLS termination on the ingress rule. Each item is a separate TLS
#                                              rule that maps to one or more hosts specified in this ingress rule. This

# envVars is a map of strings to strings that specifies hard coded environment variables that should be set on the
# application container. The keys will be mapped to environment variable keys, with the values mapping to the
# environment variable values.
#
# NOTE: If you wish to set environment variables using Secrets, see the `secrets` setting in this file.
#
# The following example configures two environment variables, DB_HOST and DB_PORT:
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# envVars:
#   DB_HOST: "mysql.default.svc.cluster.local"
#   DB_PORT: 3306
envVars: {}

# additionalContainerEnv is a list of additional environment variables

# Example:
# additionalContainerEnv:
#   - name: DD_AGENT_HOST
#     valueFrom:
#       fieldRef:
#         fieldPath: status.hostIP
#   - name: DD_ENTITY_ID
#     valueFrom:
#       fieldRef:
#         fieldPath: metadata.uid
additionalContainerEnv: {}

# configMaps is a map that specifies the ConfigMap resources that should be exposed to the main application container. Each
# entry in the map represents a ConfigMap resource. The key refers to the name of the ConfigMap that should be exposed,
# with the value specifying how to expose the ConfigMap. The value is also a map and has the following attributes:
#   - as (enum[volume,environment,envFrom,none]) (required)
#     : ConfigMaps can be exposed to Pods as a volume mount, or as environment variables. This attribute is a string
#       enum that is expected to be either "volume", "environment", or "envFrom", specifying that the ConfigMap should
#       be exposed as a mounted volume, via environment variables, or loaded as environment variables respectively.
#       This attribute can also be set to "none", which disables the `ConfigMap` on the container.
#   - mountPath (string)
#     : For ConfigMaps mounted as a volume, specify the mount path on the container file system where the config values
#       will be available.  Required when the ConfigMap is exposed as a volume. Ignored when the ConfigMap is exposed as
#       environment variables.
#   - subPath (string)
#     : For ConfigMaps mounted as a volume, specify the sub path on the volume system where the config values will be
#       available.  Optional when the ConfigMap is exposed as a volume. Ignored when the ConfigMap is exposed as
#       environment variables.
#   - items (map[ConfigMapItem])
#     : Specify how each ConfigMap value should be made available. The keys are the key of the ConfigMap that you wish
#       to configure, while the value is another map that controls how that key should be exposed. Required when the
#       ConfigMap is exposed as environment variables. When the ConfigMap is exposed as a volume, this field is optional.
#       If empty for volume ConfigMaps, all ConfigMpas will be mounted with the key as the file name relative to the
#       mountPath. See below for expected attributes.
# The expected attributes of the `ConfigMapItem` map (the submap within `items`) are:
#   - filePath   (string) : The file path relative to the ConfigMap mountPath where the value of the ConfigMap keyed at
#                           the given key of the item should be mounted to in the container. Ignored when the ConfigMap
#                           is exposed as environment variables.
#   - fileMode   (string) : The permissions mode of the file when mounted in the container. Ignored when the ConfigMap is
#                           exposed as environment variables. Expected to be the octal (e.g 777, 644). Defaults to 644.
#   - envVarName (string) : The name of the environment variable where the value of the ConfigMap keyed at the given key
#                           of the item should be stored. Ignored when the ConfigMap is exposed as a volume mount.
#
# NOTE: These config values are only automatically injected to the main application container. To add them to the side
# car containers, use the official Kubernetes Pod syntax:
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/
#
# The following example exposes the ConfigMap `myconfig` as a volume mounted to `/etc/myconfig`, while it exposes the
# ConfigMap `myotherconfig` as an environment variable.  Additionally, it automatically mounts all of the keys
# `anotherconfig` as environment variables using the `envFrom` keyword.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# configMaps:
#   myconfig:
#     as: volume
#     mountPath: /etc/myconfig

#   - as (enum[volume,environment,envFrom,none]) (required)
#     : Secrets can be exposed to Pods as a volume mount, or as environment variables. This attribute is a string enum
#       that is expected to be either "volume", "environment", or "envFrom", specifying that the Secret should be
#       exposed as a mounted volume, via environment variables, or loaded in its entirety as environment variables
#       respectively. This attribute can also be set to "none", which disables the `Secret` on the container.
#   - mountPath (string)
#     : For Secrets mounted as a volume, specify the mount path on the container file system where the secrets will be
#       available. Required when the Secret is exposed as a volume. Ignored when the Secret is exposed as environment
#       variables.
#   - items (map[SecretItem])
#     : Specify how each Secret value should be made available. The keys are the key of the Secret that you wish to
#       configure, while the value is another map that controls how that key should be exposed. Required when the Secret
#       is exposed as environment variables. When the Secret is exposed as a volume, this field is optional. If empty for
#       volume Secrets, all Secrets will be mounted with the key as the file name relative to the mountPath. See below
