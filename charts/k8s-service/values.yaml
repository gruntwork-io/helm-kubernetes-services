#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHART PARAMETERS
# This file declares the configuration input values for the k8s-service Helm chart.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REQUIRED VALUES
# These values are expected to be defined and passed in by the operator when deploying this helm chart.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# containerImage is a map that describes the container image that should be used to serve the application managed by
# this chart.
# The expected keys are:
#   - repository (string) (required) : The container image repository that should be used.
#                                      E.g `nginx` ; `gcr.io/kubernetes-helm/tiller`
#   - tag        (string) (required) : The tag of the image (e.g `latest`) that should be used. We recommend using a
#                                      fixed tag or the SHA of the image. Avoid using the tags `latest`, `head`,
#                                      `canary`, or other tags that are designed to be “floating”.
#   - pullPolicy (string)            : The image pull policy to employ. Determines when the image will be pulled in. See
#                                      the official Kubernetes docs for more info. If undefined, this will default to
#                                      `IfNotPresent`.
#
# The following example deploys the `nginx:stable` image with a `IfNotPresent` image pull policy, which indicates that
# the image should only be pulled if it has not been pulled previously.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# containerImage:
#   repository: nginx
#   tag: stable
#   pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

# applicationName is a string that names the application. This is used to label the pod and to name the main application
# container in the pod spec. The label is keyed under "gruntwork.io/app-name"


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL VALUES
# These values have defaults, but may be overridden by the operator
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# containerCommand is a list of strings that indicate a custom command to run for the container in place of the default
# configured on the image. Omit to run the default command configured on the image.
#
# Example (run echo "Hello World"):
#
# containerCommand:
#   - "echo"
#   - "Hello World"
containerCommand: null

# containerPorts is a map that specifies the ports to open on the container. This is a nested map: the first map lists
# the named ports, while the second layer lists the port spec. The named references can be used to refer to the specific
# port of the container in other resources, like Service.
# The expected keys of the port spec are:
#   - port     (int)    (required) : The port in the container that should be exposed.
#   - protocol (string) (required) : The network protocol (e.g TCP or UDP) that is exposed.
#   - disabled (bool)              : Whether or not this port is disabled. This defaults to false if unset. Provided as a
#                                    convenience to override the default ports on the commandline. For example, to
#                                    disable the default port, you can pass `--set containerPorts.http.disabled=true`.
#
# The default config exposes TCP port 80 and binds the name `http` to it.
containerPorts:
  http:
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP

# livenessProbe is a map that specifies the liveness probe of the main application container. Liveness probes indicate
# when a container has reached a fatal state where it needs to be restarted to recover. When the liveness probe fails,
# the container is automatically recreated. You can read more about container liveness probes in the official docs:
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the container spec.
#
# The following example specifies an http GET based liveness probe, that will base the probe on a http GET request to
# the port bound to name `http` (see description on `containerPorts`) on the path `/`.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# livenessProbe:
#   httpGet:
#     path: /
#     port: http
livenessProbe: {}

# readinessProbe is a map that specifies the readiness probe of the main application container. Readiness probes
# indicate when a container is unable to serve traffic. When the readiness probe fails, the container is cycled out of
# the list of available containers to the `Service`. You can read more about readiness probes in the official docs:
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the container spec.
#
# The following example specifies an http GET based readiness probe, that will base the probe on a http GET request to
# the port bound to name `http` (see description on `containerPorts`) on the path `/`.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# readinessProbe:
#   httpGet:
#     path: /
#     port: http
readinessProbe: {}

# securityContext is a map that specified the privillege and access control settings for a Pod of Container. Security Context
# can be specified when the application requires additional access control permissions. More details on securityContext and supported
# settings can be found at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/
#
# EXAMPLE:
# 1) To run a container in privilleged mode
# securityContext:
#   privilleged: true
#
# 2) To run a container as a specific user
# securityContext:
#   runAsUser: 2000
securityContext: {}


# shutdownDelay is the number of seconds to delay the shutdown sequence of the Pod by. This is implemented as a sleep
# call in the preStop hook. By default, this chart includes a preStop hook with a shutdown delay for eventual
# consistency reasons. You can read more about why you might want to do this in
# https://blog.gruntwork.io/delaying-shutdown-to-wait-for-pod-deletion-propagation-445f779a8304
# You can disable this behavior by setting this value to 0.
shutdownDelay: 5

# sideCarContainers specifies any additional containers that should be deployed as side cars to the main application
# container. This will be included in the Deployment container spec so that it will be included in the application Pod.
# This is a nested map, where the first map key is used to name the container, with the nested map being injected as the
# container spec.
#
# The following example specifies a data dog agent container as a side car with some environment variables, binding the
# name `datadog`:
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# sideCarContainers:
#   datadog:
#     image: datadog/agent:latest
#     env:
#       - name: DD_API_KEY
#         value: ASDF-1234
#       - name: SD_BACKEND
#         value: docker
sideCarContainers: {}

# canary specifies test pod(s) that are deployed alongside your application's stable track pods.
# It is useful for testing a new release candidate in a production environment with minimal disruption and
# for allowing you to find any issues early.
# The expected keys of the canary spec are:
#   - enabled        (bool) (required) : Whether or not the canary deployment should be created. If false, no canary deployment will be created.
#   - containerImage (map)  (required) : A map that specifies the application container and tag to be managed by the canary deployment. 
#                                        This has the same structure as containerImage.
#   - replicaCount   (int)             : The number of pods that should be managed by the canary deployment. Defaults to 1 if unset.
#
# The following example specifies a simple canary deployment:
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# canary:
#   enabled: true
#   replicaCount: 1
#   containerImage:
#     repository: nginx
#     tag: 1.16.0
#     pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
canary: {}

# replicaCount can be used to configure the number of replica pods that should be deployed and maintained at any given
# point in time. For example, setting to 3 will signal Kubernetes (via the Deployment contoller) to maintain 3 pods.
replicaCount: 1

# deploymentLables will add the provided map to the labels for the Deployment resource created by this chart.
# The keys and values are free form, but subject to the limitations of Kubernetes resource labels.
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the deployment spec.
deploymentLabels: {}

# deploymentAnnotations will add the provided map to the annotations for the Deployment resource created by this chart.
# The keys and values are free form, but subject to the limitations of Kubernetes resource annotations.
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the deployment spec.
deploymentAnnotations: {}

# podLabels will add the provided map to the labels for the Pod resource created by the Deployment.
# The keys and values are free form, but subject to the limitations of Kubernetes resource lables.
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the pod spec.
podLabels: {}

# podAnnotations will add the provided map to the annotations for the Pod resource created by the Deployment.
# The keys and values are free form, but subject to the limitations of Kubernetes resource annotations.
# NOTE: This variable is injected directly into the pod spec.
podAnnotations: {}

# minPodsAvailable specifies the minimum number of pods that should be available at any given point in time. This is
# used to configure a PodDisruptionBudget for the included pod. See
# https://blog.gruntwork.io/avoiding-outages-in-your-kubernetes-cluster-using-poddisruptionbudgets-ef6a4baa5085
# for an introduction to PodDisruptionBudgets.
# NOTE: setting this to 0 will skip creating the PodDisruptionBudget resource.
minPodsAvailable: 0

# service is a map that specifies the configuration for the Service resource that is created by the chart.
# The expected keys are:
#   - enabled     (bool)   (required) : Whether or not the Service resource should be created. If false, no Service
#                                       resource will be created.
#   - type        (string)            : The Service type, as defined in Kubernetes
#                                       (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types)
#                                       Defaults to ClusterIP.
#   - annotations (map)               : Annotations that should be added to the Service resource. This is injected
#                                       directly in to the resource yaml.
#   - ports       (map)    (required) : A map that specifies the port bindings of the service against the Pods in the
#                                       Deployment. This has the same structure as containerPorts, with the additional
#                                       key of `targetPort` to indicate which port of the container the service port
#                                       should route to. The `targetPort` can be a name defined in `containerPorts`.
#
# The default config configures a Service of type ClusterIP with no annotation, and binds port 80 of the pod to the
# port 80 of the service, and names the binding as `app`:
service:
  enabled: true
  ports:
    app:
      port: 80
      targetPort: http
      protocol: TCP

# servicemonitor is a map that can be used to configure a Service monitor for the operator. By default, service monitor is off.
# The expected keys are:
#   - enabled     (bool)         (required) : Whether or not the Service Monitor resource should be created. If false, no
#                                             Service Monitor resource will be created.
#   - namespace   (string)       (required) : Namespace of Endpoints object.
#   - endpoints   (list[map])    (required) : An object used to discovers targets from listed endpoints of a service.
#                                             For each endpoint address one target is discovered per port.
#                                             If the endpoint is backed by a pod, all additional container ports of the pod,
#                                             not bound to an endpoint port, are discovered as targets as well.
#
# The following example specifies a ServiceMonitor rule that describes the set of targets to be monitored by Prometheus.
# EXAMPLE:
#
# serviceMonitor:
#   enabled: true
#   namespace: monitoring
#   endpoints:
#     default:
#       interval: 10s
#       scrapeTimeout: 10s
#       honorLabels: true
#       path: /metrics
#       port: http
#       scheme: http
serviceMonitor:
  enabled: false
  namespace: monitoring
  labels: {}
  endpoints: {}

# ingress is a map that can be used to configure an Ingress resource for this service. By default, turn off ingress.
# NOTE: if you enable Ingress, then Service must also be enabled.
# The expected keys are:
#   - enabled     (bool)         (required) : Whether or not the Ingress resource should be created. If false, no
#                                             Ingress resource will be created.
#   - annotations (map)                     : Annotations that should be added to the Service resource. This is injected
#                                             directly in to the resource yaml.
#   - tls         (list[map])               : Sets up TLS termination on the ingress rule. Each item is a separate TLS
#                                             rule that maps to one or more hosts specified in this ingress rule. This
#                                             is injected directly in to the resource yaml.
#   - hosts       (list[string])            : Sets up the host routes for the ingress resource. There will be a routing
#                                             rule for each host defined in this list. If empty, will match all hosts.
#   - allowUnknownHosts (bool)              : Whether or not the Ingress resource should forward requests for unknown
#                                             hosts. If not set or set to false it won't.
#   - path        (string)       (required) : The url path to match to route to the Service.
#   - servicePort (int|string)   (required) : The port (as a number) or the name of the port on the Service to route to.
#   - additionalPaths (list[map])           : Additional paths that should be added to the ingress which will be lower
#                                             priority than the application service path. Each item corresponds to
#                                             another path, and should define `path`, `serviceName`, and `servicePort`.
#   - additionalPathsHigherPriority (list[map])
#                                           : Additional paths that should be added to the ingress which will be higher
#                                             priority than the application service path. Each item corresponds to
#                                             another path, and should define `path`, `serviceName`, and `servicePort`.
#
# The following example specifies an Ingress rule that routes chart-example.local/app to the Service port `app` with
# TLS configured using the certificate key pair in the Secret `chart-example-tls`:
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# ingress:
#   enabled: true
#   annotations:
#     kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
#     kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
#   path: /app
#   servicePort: app
#   hosts:
#     - chart-example.local
#   tls:
#     - secretName: chart-example-tls
#       hosts:
#         - chart-example.local
ingress:
  enabled: false

# envVars is a map of strings to strings that specifies hard coded environment variables that should be set on the
# application container. The keys will be mapped to environment variable keys, with the values mapping to the
# environment variable values.
#
# NOTE: If you wish to set environment variables using Secrets, see the `secrets` setting in this file.
#
# The following example configures two environment variables, DB_HOST and DB_PORT:
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# envVars:
#   DB_HOST: "mysql.default.svc.cluster.local"
#   DB_PORT: 3306
envVars: {}

# additionalContainerEnv is a list of additional environment variables
# definitions that will be inserted into the Container's environment YAML.

#       disables the `ConfigMap` on the container.
#   - mountPath (string)
#     : For ConfigMaps mounted as a volume, specify the mount path on the container file system where the config values
#       will be available.  Required when the ConfigMap is exposed as a volume. Ignored when the ConfigMap is exposed as

# AWS SPECIFIC VALUES
# These input values relate to AWS specific features, such as those relating to EKS and the AWS ALB Ingress Controller.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
aws:
  # irsa can be used to configure the projected tokens used in the IAM Roles for Service Accounts feature. This is
  # useful if you are manually annotating the projected tokens into your Pods, instead of relying on the mutating
  # admission hook.
  #
  # irsa is a map and expects the following keys:
  #   - role_arn     (string) (required) : The AWS ARN that the Service Account associated with the Pod should assume.
  #                                        Note that the projected token will not be mounted and the environment
  #                                        variables will not be set if this is an empty string (the default).
  #
  # Note that you can not use any role with the IRSA feature. It must have the proper assume role IAM policy to allow
  # the Service Account of the Pod to assume that role. See
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-service-account-iam-policy-and-role.html for more
  # information.
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  #
  # aws:
  #   irsa:
  #     role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/role-for-pod"
  #
  irsa:
    role_arn: ""


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GOOGLE SPECIFIC VALUES
# google specifies Google (GKE) specific configuration to be set via arguments/env. variables
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
google:
  # managedCertificate can be used to provision a Google Managed Certificate. Associate the ManagedCertificate object
  # to an Ingress by adding an annotation 'networking.gke.io/managed-certificates' to the Ingress.
  #
  # The expected keys are:
  #   - enabled      (bool)   (required) : Whether or not the ManagedCertificate resource should be created.
  #   - domainName   (string)            : Specifies the domain that the SSL certificate will be created for
  #   - name         (string)            : Specifies the name of the SSL certificate that you reference in Ingress with
  #                                        networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: name
  #
  # The following example specifies a ManagedCertificate with a domain name 'api.acme.com' and name 'acme-cert':
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  #
  # google:
  #   managedCertificate:
  #     enabled: true
  #     name: acme-cert
  #     domainName: api.acme.com
  #
  # NOTE: if you enable managedCertificate, then Ingress must also be enabled.
  # Use a Google Managed Certificate. By default, turn off.
