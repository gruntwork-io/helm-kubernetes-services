== Features

* Deploy your application containers on to Kubernetes
* Zero-downtime rolling deployments
* Auto scaling and auto healing
* Configuration management and Secrets management
* Ingress and Service endpoints




== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library], a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Infrastructure as Code Library before, make sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library]!

=== Core concepts

* https://gruntwork.io/guides/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-production-grade-kubernetes-cluster-aws/#core_concepts[Kubernetes core concepts]: learn about Kubernetes architecture (control plane, worker nodes), access control (authentication, authorization), resources (pods, controllers, services, config, secrets), and more.
* link:/core-concepts.md#how-do-you-run-applications-on-kubernetes[How do you run applications on Kubernetes?]
* link:/core-concepts.md#what-is-helm[What is Helm?]
* _https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action[Kubernetes in Action]_: the best book we've found for getting up and running with Kubernetes.

=== Repo organization

* link:/charts[charts]: the main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal Helm charts.
* link:/examples[examples]: This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* link:/test[test]: Automated tests for the modules and examples.


== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples[examples folder]: The `examples` folder contains sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and testing (but not production usage).

=== Production deployment
